            <h1>ABOUT ME:</h1>
            <p>My name is Isaac E. I'm 15 years old, and I am the creator of this site. I am currently interested in the
                field of medicine, but I also want to learn a bit of coding. I enjoy playing some sports for fun. Sports like
                soccer, volleyball and a bit of badminton.

            <h1>Why I Created This Site</h1>
            <p>The reason I created this site, was obviously because of the project, but also because i wanted to talk about my favorite things.
                The first image comes from one of my favorite comics, "Solo Leveling." I enjoyed the comic and although I'm not done with the side stories,
                I finished the main story. The second is from a game I used to enjoy (but I stopped playing for no reason). The last is from a bok that I loved.
